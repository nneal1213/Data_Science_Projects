A list of Data Science projects

[**1. Predicting the Outcome of Cold-Calling:**](https://github.com/nneal1213/Data_Science_Projects/tree/master/01_Cold_Calling):A gradient-boosted tree model was trained upon customer attributes to predict the likelihood of selling insurance.  The model generated a 150% improvement in sales.  

[**2. Building a Job Recommendation Engine:**](https://github.com/nneal1213/Data_Science_Projects/tree/master/02_Job_Recommendation_Engine):Through the use of Natural Language Processing and Principal Component Analysis, I had developed an engine to match job postings to the resumes of job-seekers. 
 


[**3. Improving Real Estate Price Predictions through Visual Imagery/Deep Learning:**](https//github.com/nneal1213/Data_Science_Projects/tree/master/03_Price_Prediction_Deep_Learning):A neural network was trained to recognize the intangible attributes of housing, such as "niceness", ambiance, aesthetics, and applied it to a regressor.  The model offered a 14% improvement over the state-of-the-art conventional regression model.
