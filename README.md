A list of Data Science projects

[**1. Predicting the Outcome of Cold-Calling:**](https://github.com/nneal1213/Data_Science_Projects/tree/master/01_Cold_Calling) A gradient-boosted tree model was trained upon customer attributes to predict the likelihood of selling insurance.  The model generated a 150% improvement in sales.  

[**2. Building a Job Recommendation Engine:**](https://github.com/nneal1213/Data_Science_Projects/tree/master/02_Job_Recommendation_Engine) Through the use of Natural Language Processing and Principal Component Analysis, I had developed an engine to match job postings to the resumes of job-seekers. 
 


[**3. Improving Real Estate Price Predictions through Visual Imagery/Deep Learning:**](https://github.com/nneal1213/Data_Science_Projects/tree/master/03_Price_Prediction_Deep_Learning) A neural network was trained to recognize the intangible attributes of housing, such as "niceness", ambiance, aesthetics, and applied it to a regressor.  The model offered a 14% improvement over the state-of-the-art conventional regression model.  


[**4. Creation of Web Scrapers for E-commerce Sites:**](https://github.com/nneal1213/Data_Science_Projects/tree/master/04_Scraping_Ecommerce_Sites) As part of contract work with Cherrypick.Ai, I had created 5 preliminary web-scrapers to retrieve information for various websites.  

[**5. Prediction of User Purchase through Web Actions:**](https://github.com/nneal1213/Data_Science_Projects/tree/master/05_Purchase_Prediction_Web_Actions) Feature engineering was performed upon a dataset of web actions of various users to create predictive features.  The resulting model was able to predict and identify 5x more users willing to make a purchase.  


[**6. Predicting Yelp Ratings through Review Text:**](https://github.com/nneal1213/Data_Science_Projects/tree/master/06_Predicting_YelpRating_from_Text) As part of this project, I wanted to look to see if it's possible to use NLP to parse the words in order to predict the numberes of stars given by the review.  The dataset used is the Yelp Dataset: Round 11: https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge
